				<h3>Banner Corp</h3>
				<p>Developed a website for <a href="http://www.mulrooney.co.uk/banner/colt/colt%20ethernet/index.php">Colt</a>. Still to have all its content inserted at the time of writing, this site features the use of PHP to control the breadcrumb trail and to achieve modular code with server side includes for the header and footer. jQuery was used to cause the image swapping for the navigation mouse-over and for changing the content on the Resource Centre page when the tabs were clicked. Also used was Thickbox, a jQuery/JavaScript routine that is similar in style to Lightbox. The site also features drop down navigation menus with transparency. Finally, on the Contact Us page, a JavaScript function was written to reveal the appropriate content for a country selected with a drop down menu. It degrades gracefully when JavaScript is disabled.</p>
